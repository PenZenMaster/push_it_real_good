<h1>Why You Should Never Ignore a Bee Infestation in Houston</h1><p>Discover why a bee infestation in Houston isn't just a nuisance, but a potential hazard to your home, health, and environment.</p><h2>The Cost of Delay</h2><p>Waiting to deal with a bee infestation can lead to serious property damage. Bee colonies grow quickly, and their hives can destroy drywall, insulation, and even wiring. In Houston's warm, humid climate, hives can expand rapidly, compounding these problems. Early removal prevents expensive repairs and protects your home.</p><h2>Health Hazards to Your Family</h2><p>Bee stings are not only painful, but for some individuals they can be life-threatening. If a hive is disturbed or threatened, bees may become aggressive and attack in swarms. This is especially dangerous for children, pets, and those with allergies. Quick action minimizes the risk of injury and medical emergencies.</p><h2>Structural and Environmental Impact</h2><p>Bees nesting in walls or attics can weaken structural materials over time. Additionally, if the hive is exterminated but not removed, it may attract pests such as ants, roaches, or rodents. Proper removal protects both your homeâ€™s structure and the surrounding environment from secondary infestations.</p>
