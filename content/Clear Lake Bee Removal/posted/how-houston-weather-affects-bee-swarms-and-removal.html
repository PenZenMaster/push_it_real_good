<h1>How Houston Weather Affects Bee Swarms and Removal</h1><p>Learn how Houston's unique climate influences bee behavior, swarming patterns, and when to schedule removal.</p><h2>Spring Swarming Season</h2><p>In Houston, bee swarms are most common in spring when colonies split and search for new homes. Sudden warm spells and heavy rainfall can trigger this behavior. Homeowners should stay alert to unusual buzzing or bee clusters near their roofline or trees.</p><h2>Summer Heat and Hive Expansion</h2><p>Hot, humid summers accelerate hive growth and increase the urgency for removal. Colonies may become aggressive when temperatures soar or when resources are scarce. Itâ€™s critical to address infestations early in the summer season before the hive becomes unmanageable.</p><h2>When to Call a Pro</h2><p>Timing is everything. The best time to remove a hive is during early morning or late evening when bees are less active. Our team monitors Houston weather trends and plans removals accordingly for safety and effectiveness.</p>
